    "# Prior Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past few decades, the United States has seen a dramatic increase in the number of dam removals. Dams are removed for a variety of reasons, including safety, cost, and loss of function as dams reach the end of their engineered lifecycles. Additionally, as we've learned more about the ecological effects of dam construction and maintenance, the recovery of ecosystem function has become a pertinent goal accross dam removals (Bellmore et al. 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "The removal of Condit Dam is an important case study on the effects of dam removals on surrounding landscapes. Located on the White Salmon River in southwest Washington State, the dam was removed in 2011 and was the largest dam removal in the United States at the time. It released 180,000 m<sup>3</sup> of impounded sediment, the largest volume ever released in the US by breaching a dam with explosives. (Allen et al. 2016). The White Salmon River is an important salmon habitat and has historically been integral to salmon hatchery programs in the Columbia River Gorge. The health of its salmon populations are especially important to the physical, spiritual, and cultural nourishment of the Yakama Nation (\"White Salmon River\", _American Rivers_). \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, salmon have returned to upstream spawning grounds on the White Salmon River. Their recovery is in part due to the White Salmon Working Group (WSWG), a conservation group formed in 2006 to assess fish populations and develop a plan to mitigate the effects of the dam's removal. The WSWG relocated Chinook salmon and allowed other species to naturally recolonize, which led to the repopulation and recolonization of salmon accross species following the removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another river in southwest Washington, the Lewis river still currently has a dam (four, actually). Its facilities deny access to traditional spawning habitat for a majority of adult Lower Columbia River salmon and prevent juvenile salmon from migrating to the ocean (\"Lewis River\", _American Rivers_). Its ecological makeup is comparable to the White Salmon River pre dam removal, from its native salmon species to its winding rapids.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dam removals have historically been regarded as reversing the negative effects of dam construction. However, the reality isn't that simple. Ecological response trajectories post dam removal may be more complicated than a simple linear healing period in which the river and surrounding ecosystem gradually returns to what it looked like prior to construction. In fact, new ecologic conditions may not resemble the predam conditions, even as the river heals (Bellmore et al. 2019). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are important differences in ecological response trajectories between locations relative to the removed dam. We see a general movement of organisms upstream of the former reservoir, where they tend to recolonize or initially colonize new habitats. Dam removal may also facilitate the spread of invasive species upstream, so the native species may be pushed out. Within the former reservoir, major physical and hydrologic changes trigger large ecological responses. Lotic fish species (those which prefer flowing rivers to static environments) may repopulate. Downstream, the effects of released sediment create an unstable streambed not suitable for many species. Here, where living conditions are generally worst following the removal, lowered fish abundance may persist as long as 15 years before populations increase again. All three domains interact with each other, creating dynamic trajectories which indicate the complexity of ecological regrowth (Bellmore et al. 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the central position of salmon in the White Salmon River's ecosystem and the magnitude of Condit Dam's removal, it is important we understand how the removal affected salmon populations. We must consider how dynamic healing trajectories might complicate narratives about healing post dam removal. "

    "In this case, the treatment effect among the treated (the salmon directly affected by the removal of Condit Dam) is most relevant. Particularly since dam removals are so specific to the unique environmental and architectural conditions of each dam, it is more impactful to consider how this dam removal affected its local salmon populations than to consider the difference between salmon of affected and unaffected rivers.

    "# Design\n",
    "\n",
    "## Study strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The following study is a difference-in-differences quasi experiment. These experiments look at the difference in outcomes between a treatment and control group before and after a chance event. My treatment group will be the White Salmon River, where the dam was removed, and my control group will be Lewis River, whose salmon populations are still affected by dams. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "1. Consistency: Since all salmon in the treated group are affected by the same chance event (the removal of Condit Dam), there is only realistically one version of the treatment. Therefore, the observed outcomes will reflect the hypothetical outcomes.\n",
    "2. No interference: In an ecosystem, any event may have effects that ripple outwards to other parts of the system. However, since the rivers with treatment and control salmon are not directly connected, I think it is fair to say that the no interference assumption holds. Additionally, salmon that migrate due to dam removal tend to travel upstream away from released sediment, and they would have to travel downstream from the White Salmon River to reach Lewis River. \n",
    "3. Parallel trends: Based on the graph below, I think it is reasonable to say that the parallel trends assumption holds. The graph has large error bars, which could mean that parallelism is increased _or_ decreased in reality. However, the parallel trends of other rivers are vastly different, so I think it is fair to say that these ones are comparable. There are three confounders I identified that would affect the White Salmon River more than the Lewis river: sample location, infrastructural barriers, and the White Salmon Working Group (WSWG). Since dam removals have different effects at different points on the river, the location (which we cannot determine from the dataset) could differently affect the White Salmon River's survey results. Infrastructural barriers like boundaries around the demolition zone would likely affect the sampling capabilities for the White Salmon River. The WSWG's efforts at salmon relocation and conservation would only affect the treatment group.\n",

It helps monitor the status and trends of Coastal, Puget Sound, and Columbia Basin salmonid stocks. To provide evidence of salmonid spawning activity, it records counts of adult fish and redds. Each sample has a unique survey ID, survey date, stream name, and run year and often includes species data. It more sparingly includes the estimated percent seen, dead total, and redd data. It has data going back to 1930 and is still updated daily.\n",

    "As described in the parallel trends discussion, sample location, infrastructural barriers, and the WSWG's efforts are three confounders that could affect the treatment and control groups differently. These confounders are not represented in the dataset. Environmental factors are another confounder, but are so difficult to measure that for my study I assume that the rivers are being affected similarly (this seems reasonable as they are both in Southwest Washington and have other similar characteristics)."

    "# Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The point estimate for the linear regression model suggests that the removal of Condit Dam decreased the size of White Salmon River's population by about 60 compared to if trends had followed in the pre-treatment data. When we look at the two-way fixed effects regression results, we see a more complicated narrative of post-treatment effects. The 2012 estimate of roughly -47 is uniquely less negative than other post-treatment data. 2014 sees a significant decrease, however, with the point estimate being about -281. From there point estimates remain roughly around -87 from 2015 to 2020. All estimates have large confidence intervals, and in general the results are inconclusive. However, the dramatic decrease in 2014, as well as the general decrease in the years 2015-2020, may be significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this estimation used the ATT, the results apply to salmon in the White Salmon River following the removal of Condit Dam. These results are not generalizable to another population, though they may provide insight into dam removals and salmon spawning rates that could be useful in motivating studies elsewhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many limitations on my study design and analysis. Missing data means that parallel trends and the estimates that depend on those trends may be inaccurate. The data also relies on the surveys from field work observation, which may involve natural human error. The Lewis River does not have data for 2013; the reason for this gap is not given in the dataset but may be related to the significant decrease in salmon population size in 2014. In general, ecological data is difficult to model. As Bellmore et al. note, ecological response trajectories including salmon spawn rates may be affected my multiple causal pathways and feedback loops (Bellmore et al. 2019, 4). Accurately modeling the effects of dam removal on salmon spawn rates will necessitate more complex models, and ideally more thorough data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Condit Dam was removed in 2011, but we don't see a significant decrease in fish populations until 2014. The WSWG attempted to promote Chinook salmon recolonization upstream of the removed dam. They found that in the year following the removal, salmon populations remained stable, but provided little analysis for the coming years (Allen et al. 2016, 200). The decrease in 2014 may be reflective of salmon populations struggling to recolonize different habitats long term. Overall, the data is inconclusive, but a surprising decrease three years after the removal indicates a need for more thorough long-term analysis of the effects of dam removals on salmon populations. Further studies should be done to inform future salmon conservation or relocation plans. Statistical analysis combined with expert ecological knowledge could help determine the best course of action for salmon relocation prior to dam removal and support the ecosystem recovery that motivates many dam removals.
